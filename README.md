# 🌱 Git Practice Garden

A safe space to experiment, learn, and grow my Git skills. Here, I plant seeds of code, nurture them with commits, and watch my understanding branch out.

## What's Here?
This repository contains:
- Simple code snippets (Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, etc.).
- Experimental files created while learning Git commands.
- Notes and reflections on my Git journey.

## My Learning Goals
- [x] Initialize a repository
- [x] Stage and commit changes
- [ ] Create and merge branches
- [ ] Understand `git merge` vs `git rebase`
- [ ] Collaborate via GitHub (future)

## How to Use This Repo
*This repository is a playground.* Feel free to explore the commit history to see my progress and mistakes. It's a log of my learning process.
